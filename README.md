# Unity-Logs-Viewer
Using this tool you can easily check your editor console logs inside the game itself!
All what you have to do is to make a circle gesture using your mouse (click and drag) or your finger (touch and drag) on the mobile screen to show all these logs!

This fork works for Unity 5.3+

You can download also from unity asset store
