# Unity-Logs-Viewer
Using this tool you can easily check your editor console logs inside the game itself! 
All what you have to do is to make a circle gesture using your mouse (click and drag) or your finger (touch and drag) on the mobile screen to show all these logs! 

You can download also from unity asset store
